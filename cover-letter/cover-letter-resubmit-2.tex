\opening{Dear Graham,}

I am writing on behalf of my coauthors to resubmit our 
manuscript entitled
\emph{A general and efficient representation of ancestral recombination
graphs}. 

We are delighted that it is potentially suitable for publication in GENETICS,
and have endeavored to address the points you have raised.

We have attached a detailed point-by-point response in the 
\texttt{response-to-reviewers-2.pdf} file, along with a 
latex-diff of the differences between the current and previous submissions.

Thank you again for your careful and helpful input throughout this process.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
